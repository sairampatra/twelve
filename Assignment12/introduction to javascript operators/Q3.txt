Q-Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.

A-// Unary Operators:
// - Operate on a single operand.
// Example:
let negation = !true; // Logical NOT
let increment = counter++; // Post-increment

// Binary Operators:
// - Operate on two operands.
// Example:
let sum = 5 + 3; // Addition
let isEqual = (2===2);  equality

// Ternary Operator:
// - Operates on three operands and provides a shorthand for an if-else statement.
// Example:
let result = (3>2) ? "True" : "False";

// In summary, unary operators work with one operand, binary operators with two,
// and the ternary operator with three, offering different levels of complexity and functionality.
